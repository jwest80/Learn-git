README - Learn-git
-------------------------------

* Get a local copy of the project.
	* git clone [url]
		Examples:
			$ git clone git@github.com:jwest80:Learn-git.git
			$ git clone git@github.com:auditconf/auditconfirmations.git
	*
	
* Basic Snapshotting
	* git add - Start tracking new file or changes to a file (Adds file to Staging area)
		-A : Adds all files being tracked to staging area.
	* git status - To be commited and New or Modified Files not in staging area.
	* git diff - Shows differences between files (My Windows Version seems to be breaking, or I don't know what im doing?)
	* git commit - Records a snapshot of staging area
		Example:
			$git commit -m 'I made some changes'
			(leaving off the -m will open vim for you to add comments)
	* git reset Head [file] & git rm [file]
		* reset Head - "unstages" a file or reverts the file to what it was before we started modifying things. 
		* rm - will remove the file from the staging area entirely and from your disk (effectivly deleting it). You can keep it on the disk by using rm --cached.
	*
		
* Other Tips
	* Add an alias (Does not seem to working with Windows Version)
		$ config --global alias.unstage "reset HEAD"  
		Now you can unstage like this git unstage --[file] instead of git reset HEAD --[file]
